# 1 Week of Mastering Python

I took 1 week and did some simple projects to test my ability to work with different scenerio.



## Projects I choose:
- Hangman Game
- Timer Application
- E-mail Slicer
- Number Guessing Game
- Website Blocker
- Text to Speech Application
## Run these projects on your PC

1. Clone this project in your pc:
Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in your system.
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/shamiulalamupom/pythonmasteringprojects
  cd pythonmasteringprojects
  code .
```
It will open the project folder in your IDE.

2. Open a terminal and create a virtual environment like this:
```bash
  python -m venv .venv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
  .venv/Scripts/activate
```
4. Install all packages from requirements.txt:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Copy and paste each block of code to main.py file to run that specific project.
